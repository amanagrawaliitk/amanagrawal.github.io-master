I am a Graduate Candidate in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Univeristy of Houston. 

Before joining University of Houston, I worked at Center of Soft and Living Matters in South Korea with Professor Steve Granick. 

I completed by BTech and MTech in Chemical Engineering from IIT Kanpur in 2015. Apart from research, I like to travel around the world to gain new experiences and expand the horizon of my knowledge and skills.
